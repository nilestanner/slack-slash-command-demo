A dead simple example to implement a Slack Slash command.

## Deploy to Heroku
[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Run locally
Clone the repo then:
```
npm install
node index.js
```
## What does it do?
This example creates a end point that can be hit with a slack slash command. The action it takes is converting a 2- or 3-digit Country code into it's respective name. Deploying this application will not create the application in slack. This demo is only intended as the backend portion.
